## Database Design
- ### Users
    - **Fields**: email, password, first_name, last_name, 
    - **relationships**: can have many bookings, can have many reviews, can have many properties, can have many payments
- ### Properties
    - **Fields**: name, description, address, price_per_night, max_guests, 
    - **relationships**: can have many bookings, can have many reviews, can have many payments
- ### Bookings
    - **Fields**: start_date, end_date, total_price, 
    - **relationships**: belongs to a property, belongs to a user

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Handles user registration, login, and secure authentication. Users can manage profiles, upload pictures, and update preferences. Roles are defined for guests and hosts with different permissions.

- **Property Management**: Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with images, descriptions, pricing, and availability. Listings are searchable and include detailed pages with reviews and host info.

- **Booking System**: Guests can book available properties, view booking details, and cancel if needed. The system checks availability in real-time and updates the booking calendar accordingly.

- **Payment Processing**: Integrates with payment gateways to handle transactions securely. Tracks payment status, processes refunds, and allows hosts to manage payout settings.

- **Review System**: Guests and hosts can leave reviews after a stay, rating aspects like cleanliness and accuracy. Reviews are moderated and displayed after submission by both parties.

- **Data Optimization**: Improves app speed and performance using caching, data compression, and database indexing. Helps handle large-scale traffic efficiently and reduces load times.

## API Security


- **Authentication**: All users must log in to access protected resources using secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This prevents unauthorized access and ensures user sessions are valid.

- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only users with proper roles (e.g., host, guest, admin) can perform specific actions. This helps enforce business rules and protects critical operations.

- **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting will be applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse and protect against brute-force attacks. It helps maintain service availability and reduces the risk of denial-of-service attacks.

- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information will be encrypted in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest. This is essential to protect user data and financial details.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: All inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This protects the integrity and security of the application.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the building, testing, and deployment of code, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. They help catch bugs early, reduce manual deployment errors, and maintain consistent code quality.

For this project, tools like GitHub Actions can automate workflows for running tests and deploying code. Docker can containerize the application for consistent environments, while services like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS can be used for automated deployments.
